    "text": "Project Work\nOver the summer we focused on building the eye mechanism as we believed the eyes would likely be one of the most difficult parts of the design. ### Eye Prototype 1: The Swing Grabbing inspiration from a Youtube video on building animatronic eyes, we first started with an eye prototype that incorporated individual horizontal motion but shared vertical motion. The design required three servos, two servos for the horizontal movement of each eye, and then one servo to control the vertical movement through a swing that the both eyes sit on (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: First eye prototype with two servos to control the horizontal motion of each eye. The image shows the prototype’s ability to perform “cross-eye” motion. However, the prototype’s “outward-eye” motion was much more limited than desired.\n\n\n\nThe biggest challenge we ran into with this prototype was the length of the horizontal arm that attached to the eye as the length allowed for a greater degree of movement in one horizontal direction and not the other. The complexity of the swing and its placement would also further affect the flexibility of movement of the horizontal servos. So instead we decided to forego the swing prototype and try controlling each eye individually.\n\nEye Prototype 2: Four Motor Socket\nThis prototype gets its name from using four servo motors to control both eyes (two for each eye) such that each eye is able to move independently as well as the ball-socket rods that were used to allow for the eye to rotate without translating from its position (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Second eye prototype with four servos: one for horizontal motion and one for vertical motion of an individual eye. The image shows the prototype’s attachment system to the eye itself and to the base that would attach to the head of the robot.\n\n\n\nThe biggest challenge we ran into with this prototype was figuring out the right eye size to allow large movement but still stay true to the robot’s character design as well as the length of the rods connecting the servo and the ball/joint attached to the eye. However, this prototype was succesful! It provided a desirable motion range without translating meaning the eye will move around without getting stuck on the eye sockets of the robot’s head.\n\n\nCurrent and Future Direction\nWe are currently making slow progress due to classes being in session. But our next steps are to design the jaw mechanism that rotates the head of the robot up around a hinge and separates the head from the bottom body to look like a the in-game character when its mouth is agape (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: REPO Robot character in-game opening its jaw.\n\n\n\nFuture work will include designing the electrical components such as the microphone to intake audio and open the jaw accordingly as well as programming the arduino code to move the eyes in a random or set pathway."

When YAPA kids was just beginning, our team was a small group of three, but one night the program skyrocketed in applications from only 20 to 30 applications at a time to thousands of applications. The sudden influx of applicants posed a serious challenge. I expanded my team with more dedicated program volunteers, but we could barely make a dent in the mountain of applications. Stepping further into my director role, I developed a completely new holistic application process with my team to fairly evaluate each applicant and effectively find those committed to the program’s mission with reasonable application response time. With the new application framework the program was able to oversee more than 600 passionate volunteers."

I am working with the company XDemics whose mission is to automate the manual manipulation of bioreactors in order to increase production and quality of life-saving biologics specifically in the realm of gene therapies. Automation would also reduce waste and probability of contamination during the cell seeding and harvesting procedure.

We have also completed a thorough work plan including a literature review of relevant theory and pre-exisiting methods and a technical approach for this upcoming semester’s tasks. We are in the process of ideating design alternatives and converging on one prototype to continue building upon. We will be visiting the XDemics work site to aid in clarifying the necessary movements and possible constraints of our robotic system. The goal by the end of the year is to design a high fidelity prototype of a robotic system that can successfully manipulate the bioreactor with equal or greater cell throughput than the current manual process.\nEvery week we also meet with other teams in a Design Review session where one team will get to share their progress on the project as well as receive feedback on challenges or designs from the other teams. Our goal with design reviews is to engage the other teams in such a way that we can gather as much feedback and ideas as possible."

The electrical design also included interfacing the circuit with an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) to read and process the voltages and convert the voltage back to strain.\nThe project opened many avenues of learning from big technical skills like communicating to a microcontroller and analyzing noise sources to small skills like how to familiarize myself with an instrument’s datasheet.

    "text": "Research Work\nMy role on the Rhizosphere project mainly involves designing, building, aligning, and testing the optical systems including automating data collection. My inital work on the project (2024) was to build a system that could image a mung bean stem and measure light transmission through the stem. With my lab partner, Audrey Gruian, I constructed a USB camera microscope that magnified the mung bean stem enough to visualize the stem’s hollow center. We were able to take images of the mung bean stem using this apparatus.\nI then worked on a mung bean “cage” setup to measure light transmission through the stem by feeding red He-Ne laser light into the stem by way of an optical fiber and capturing the transmitted light with a photodetector (Figure 2). Through this setup, we were able to measure changes in transmission across mung beans of different length as well as visualize the drop off of transmission as the stem wilts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Setup of transmission measurement with the He-Ne laser being fed by fiber into the mung bean plant and captured by a Si Photodetector.\n\n\n\nThis past summer (2025), I worked with Grey Seymour on moving towards measuring backscatter rather than transmission and towards using Arabidopsis Thaliana instead of mung beans for its applicability to a wide range of flowering plants. I first started by building an interferometer with an electrical optical modulator (EOM) to manipulate the phase of the reference wave. I wrote a Python program using the nidaqmx package to capture the data from our data acquistion device and fit the curve to the expected sinusoidal interference equation.\nHowever, due to the sensitivity of our system to miniscule changes in the environment (e.g. slight table movement, activity from the other lab members, etc.), the wide variability of the results proved inconclusive in verifying the EOM interferometry setup. We decided to move towards a low coherence interferometer (LCI) setup to preserve a high resolution in measurements while limiting the sensitivity to environmental variables (Figure 3 (a) and Figure 3 (b)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) A drawing of the Low Coherence Interferometer (LCI) setup with an 850 nm super luminescent diode (SLD) feeding into a polarizer, then split 50:50 by a 2x2 coupler into a sample and reference beam that when reflected recombine into the photodiode (PD). The signal is then fed into a photodiode amplifier (PA), read by the data acquistion device (NiDAQ), and saved on the computer through code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) A labeled picture of the physical in-lab LCI setup. The sample in this setup is a TIR retroreflection with an AR coating for 350-700 nm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\nTowards the end of the summer, I wrote a Python script on Colab to simulate and understand the expected interference pattern and coherence length of a monochrome (single wavelength) source versus a broadband source. Then, I designed, built, and aligned an LCI interferometer with a near-infrared super luminescent diode as its broadband source. The end of the summer was the beginning of attempting to verify the LCI setup using a TIR retroreflector as the sample. I wrote a program incorporating the nidaqmx and pylablib packages to automate collecting data while moving the reference mirror stage (see code block below).\n\n\nLCISweepCONTINUOUS.py\n\n    from pylablib.devices import Thorlabs\n    import nidaqmx\n    from nidaqmx.constants import TerminalConfiguration, AcquisitionType, READ_ALL_AVAILABLE\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    import csv\n    import numpy as np\n    import os\n    import time\n    from datetime import datetime\n    from scipy.fft import fft, fftfreq\n    from scipy.optimize import curve_fit\n\n    def create_folder(folder_name):\n        try:\n            os.mkdir(folder_name)\n            print(f\"Folder '{folder_name}' created successfully.\")\n        except FileExistsError:\n            print(f\"Folder '{folder_name}' already exists.\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n    def move_to_folder(folder_name):\n        try:\n            os.chdir(folder_name)\n            print(f\"Current directory changed to: {os.getcwd()}\")\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            print(f\"Folder '{folder_name}' not found.\")\n        except NotADirectoryError:\n            print(f\"'{folder_name}' is not a directory.\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n    def create_csv_file(filename, fields, datarows):\n        with open(filename, 'w') as csvfile:\n            # create csv writer object\n            csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile, lineterminator='\\n')\n\n            # writing the fields\n            csvwriter.writerow(fields)\n\n            # writing the data rows\n            csvwriter.writerows(datarows)\n\n    def take_data():\n        with nidaqmx.Task() as task:\n            task.ai_channels.add_ai_voltage_chan(\"Dev1/ai1\", \n                                                max_val=10, \n                                                terminal_config= TerminalConfiguration.RSE)\n\n            task.timing.cfg_samp_clk_timing(1000000, \n                                            sample_mode=AcquisitionType.FINITE, \n                                            samps_per_chan=1000)\n            rawdata = task.read(READ_ALL_AVAILABLE)\n        return rawdata\n\n    def find_amp(data):\n        sorted_data = sorted(data)\n\n        # calculate minimum average of bottom 100 values\n        averagemin = np.mean(sorted_data[0:99])\n\n        # calculate maximum average of top 100 values\n        averagemax = np.mean(sorted_data[len(sorted_data)-100:len(sorted_data)])\n\n        # calculate amplitude\n        amplitude = averagemax -
