The project's scope revolves around evaluating the ability of low coherence interferometry in producing depth scans of the *Arabidopsis Thaliana* root *in situ*. \n\n## Research Work\nMy role on the Rhizosphere project mainly involves designing, building, aligning, and testing the optical systems including automating data collection. My inital work on the project (2024) was to build a system that could image a mung bean stem and measure light transmission through the stem. With my lab partner, Audrey Gruian, I constructed a USB camera microscope that magnified the mung bean stem enough to visualize the stem's hollow center. We were able to take images of the mung bean stem using this apparatus. \n\nI then worked on a mung bean \"cage\" setup to measure light transmission through the stem by feeding red He-Ne laser light into the stem by way of an optical fiber and capturing the transmitted light with a photodetector (@fig-transmission). Through this setup, we were able to measure changes in transmission across mung beans of different length as well as visualize the drop off of transmission as the stem wilts. \n\n![Setup of transmission measurement with the He-Ne laser being fed by fiber into the mung bean plant and captured by a Si Photodetector.](images/transmissionsetup.png){#fig-transmission}\n\nThis past summer (2025), I worked with Grey Seymour on moving towards measuring backscatter rather than transmission and towards using *Arabidopsis Thaliana* instead of mung beans for its applicability to a wide range of flowering plants. I first started by building an interferometer with an electrical optical modulator (EOM) to manipulate the phase of the reference wave. I wrote a Python program using the `nidaqmx` package to capture the data from our data acquistion device and fit the curve to the expected sinusoidal interference equation.\n\nHowever, due to the sensitivity of our system to miniscule changes in the environment (e.g. slight table movement, activity from the other lab members, etc.), the wide variability of the results proved inconclusive in verifying the EOM interferometry setup. We decided to move towards a low coherence interferometer (LCI) setup to preserve a high resolution in measurements while limiting the sensitivity to environmental variables (@fig-lcidrawing and @fig-lcipic). \n\n::: {#fig-plots layout-ncol=2 layout-valign=\"bottom\"}\n![A drawing of the Low Coherence Interferometer (LCI) setup with an 850 nm super luminescent diode (SLD) feeding into a polarizer, then split 50:50 by a 2x2 coupler into a sample and reference beam that when reflected recombine into the photodiode (PD). The signal is then fed into a photodiode amplifier (PA), read by the data acquistion device (NiDAQ), and saved on the computer through code.](images/lcidrawing.png){#fig-lcidrawing}\n\n![A labeled picture of the physical in-lab LCI setup.

Then, I designed, built, and aligned an LCI interferometer with a near-infrared super luminescent diode as its broadband source. The end of the summer was the beginning of attempting to verify the LCI setup using a TIR retroreflector as the sample. I wrote a program incorporating the `nidaqmx` and `pylablib` packages to automate collecting data while moving the reference mirror stage (see code block below).  \n\n<details>\n<summary>LCISweepCONTINUOUS.py</summary>\n\n```\n    from pylablib.devices import Thorlabs\n    import nidaqmx\n    from nidaqmx.constants import TerminalConfiguration, AcquisitionType, READ_ALL_AVAILABLE\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    import csv\n    import numpy as np\n    import os\n    import time\n    from datetime import datetime\n    from scipy.fft import fft, fftfreq\n    from scipy.optimize import curve_fit\n\n    def create_folder(folder_name):\n        try:\n            os.mkdir(folder_name)\n            print(f\"Folder '{folder_name}' created successfully.\")\n        except FileExistsError:\n            print(f\"Folder '{folder_name}' already exists.\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n    def move_to_folder(folder_name):\n        try:\n            os.chdir(folder_name)\n            print(f\"Current directory changed to: {os.getcwd()}\")\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            print(f\"Folder '{folder_name}' not found.\")\n        except NotADirectoryError:\n            print(f\"'{folder_name}' is not a directory.\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n    def create_csv_file(filename, fields, datarows):\n        with open(filename, 'w') as csvfile:\n            # create csv writer object\n            csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile, lineterminator='\\n')\n\n            # writing the fields\n            csvwriter.writerow(fields)\n\n            # writing the data rows\n            csvwriter.writerows(datarows)\n\n    def take_data():\n        with nidaqmx.Task() as task:\n            task.ai_channels.add_ai_voltage_chan(\"Dev1/ai1\", \n                                                max_val=10, \n                                                terminal_config= TerminalConfiguration.RSE)\n\n            task.timing.cfg_samp_clk_timing(1000000, \n                                            sample_mode=AcquisitionType.FINITE, \n                                            samps_per_chan=1000)\n            rawdata = task.read(READ_ALL_AVAILABLE)\n        return rawdata\n\n    def find_amp(data):\n        sorted_data = sorted(data)\n\n        # calculate minimum average of bottom 100 values\n        averagemin = np.mean(sorted_data[0:99])\n\n        # calculate maximum average of top 100 values\n        averagemax = np.mean(sorted_data[len(sorted_data)-100:len(sorted_data)])\n\n        # calculate amplitude\n        amplitude = averagemax -

Each lab notebook contained a checklist of action items for the day, a section for what was completed that day/where we were stuck/what action items were planned for the next day, and a section for detailed documentation of our work that day (@fig-notebook). Weekly summaries included what was achieved that week and what goals we were setting for the next week. I learned greatly in this lab how important documentation can be especially when reproducing lab setups and revisiting results. I also worked with a different lab partner my second summer in the lab. The daily lab notebooks were incredible handy in onboarding the new member. \n\n![Example of daily notebook for documenting research progress. Structure includes overarching goals for the summer, action items for the day, a summary for what was finished, where we got stuck, and action items for the next day, and detailed notes of the procedure for the day.](images/dailynotebook.png){#fig-notebook}\n\nIn addition to daily lab notebooks, over the summer terms we had two presentations we gave to the rest of the research groups in the program as well as a summary of our summer progress in a white paper and a poster. The poster is presented at a gallery walk in front of the school where students and staff could ask about our experience and research in the lab (@fig-poster). \n\n![Monitoring the Rhizosphere poster for Fall 2026 summer research presentations.](images/rhizoposter.jpg){#fig-poster}\n\n## White Paper Links\n\n[Summer 2025 Research Report](https://erinlywang.github.io/rhizo-report-2025/)\nSummer 2024 Research Report\n\n## Acknowledgements\nI want to acknowledge my advisor Professor Brake for his incredible mentorship and for the opportunities he gave me to make the research my own. I got to lead and mold the project to to incorporate skills I had always wanted to learn or strengthen.

We hope to finish verifying the LCI setup and move to implementing the Arabidopsis stem to present for the SPIE conference in the Spring. \n\n## Documentation\nDaily lab notebooks were kept on Confluence along with a weekly summary and all lab notebooks linked on a parent page. Each lab notebook contained a checklist of action items for the day, a section for what was completed that day/where we were stuck/what action items were planned for the next day, and a section for detailed documentation of our work that day (@fig-notebook). Weekly summaries included what was achieved that week and what goals we were setting for the next week. I learned greatly in this lab how important documentation can be especially when reproducing lab setups and revisiting results. I also worked with a different lab partner my second summer in the lab. The daily lab notebooks were incredible handy in onboarding the new member. \n\n![Example of daily notebook for documenting research progress. Structure includes overarching goals for the summer, action items for the day, a summary for what was finished, where we got stuck, and action items for the next day, and detailed notes of the procedure for the day.](images/dailynotebook.png){#fig-notebook}\n\nIn addition to daily lab notebooks, over the summer terms we had two presentations we gave to the rest of the research groups in the program as well as a summary of our summer progress in a white paper and a poster. The poster is presented at a gallery walk in front of the school where students and staff could ask about our experience and research in the lab (@fig-poster). \n\n![Monitoring the Rhizosphere poster for Fall 2026 summer research presentations.](images/rhizoposter.jpg){#fig-poster}\n\n## White Paper Links\n\n[Summer 2025 Research Report](https://erinlywang.github.io/rhizo-report-2025/)\nSummer 2024 Research Report\n\n## Acknowledgements\nI want to acknowledge my advisor Professor Brake for his incredible mentorship and for the opportunities he gave me to make the research my own. I got to lead and mold the project to to incorporate skills I had always wanted to learn or strengthen. I also want to acknowledge my incredible research team for creating an environment that I looked forward to coming to every day. And lastly, an acknowledgement to Harvey Mudd and the resources they provide to us students to be able to conduct research under close advising from our professors. I am extremely grateful for the research experiences I've been able to have here at Harvey Mudd.
