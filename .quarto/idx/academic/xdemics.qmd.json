The project work includes documentation deliverables as well as a completed prototype. Juniors will stay on the project for a semester while seniors stay on the project for the whole year. \n\nAs a senior, I am taking clinic for the whole year. The fall semester we focus on defining the project, initial research and ideation, and rapid prototyping whereas in the spring we focus on expanding on one prototype to meet the specs, constraints, and objectives of the project. I am working with the company XDemics whose mission is to automate the manual manipulation of bioreactors in order to increase production and quality of life-saving biologics specifically in the realm of gene therapies. Automation would also reduce waste and probability of contamination during the cell seeding and harvesting procedure. Thus, my clinic team was asked to design a multiaxis robotic system that can rotate, tilt, and agitate the XDemics' bioreactor and optimize the automated manipulation procedure to maximize cell throughput. \n\n## Project Work\nAs a co-lead for my clinic team, I have been able to experience much more of the management side of clinic including scheduling and planning meeting agendas for internal team meetings and external meetings with our team advisor and liaisons, outlining timelines for the projects with set dates for submitting documentation and prototype deliverables, organizing the budget between discretionary, travel, and equipment, leading communication between the team and the liaisons, and overall directing the flow of work and communication such that the team has both an educational and a fun clinic experience. \n\nCurrently, my team has finished scoping out the project with redefining the project statement and solidifying the project's objectives, specifications, constraints, and deliverables in accordance with the liaisons. We have also completed a thorough work plan including a literature review of relevant theory and pre-exisiting methods and a technical approach for this upcoming semester's tasks. We are in the process of ideating design alternatives and converging on one prototype to continue building upon. We will be visiting the XDemics work site to aid in clarifying the necessary movements and possible constraints of our robotic system. The goal by the end of the year is to design a high fidelity prototype of a robotic system that can successfully manipulate the bioreactor with equal or greater cell throughput than the current manual process.\n\nEvery week we also meet with other teams in a Design Review session where one team will get to share their progress on the project as well as receive feedback on challenges or designs from the other teams. Our goal with design reviews is to engage the other teams in such a way that we can gather as much feedback and ideas as possible.\n\n## Documentation\nDocumentation is one of the major responsibilities for co-leads of the team. I have worked on outlining the projected timeline of the semester and expectations of the project by creating a work breakdown schedule (WBS) and a Gantt Chart as well as in an extensive work plan. Progress is kept with an action items chart complete with progress bars for easy tracking. Each meeting has a corresponding meeting minutes that outlines the next steps and action items for the team as well as for the liaisons. I and my fellow co-lead also setup working documents to track progress and reasonings behind design choices such as a morphological chart for a condensed table of functions and means and a Pugh chart to rank the design alternatives based on their ability to meet an objective as well as the importance of said objective. All progress and justification of designs will also be culminated into a midyear report. \n\n\n## Acknowledgements\nI want to acknowledge my team advisor Professor Angie Lee for her advising of the Clinic project. She has given wise advice and gently guided the team without managing the project. I also want to thank my clinic team and team co-lead for approaching clinic with curiosity and enthusiasm as well as to the clinic liaisons at Trilobio for their effective communication and eager support. And a special thanks to the coordinators of the clinic class for giving us as undergraduate students the rare opportunity to work on a project provided an overseen by an industry company.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n![XDemics Banner](images/xdemicsbanner.png)\n\n## Motivation\nThe clinic project is student-driven with a professor team advisor for technical and management support.
