## Motivation
Clinic is a class at Harvey Mudd that connects students to companies in industry. Students are split into teams and assigned to a company that will then provide a project for the students to engineer. The clinic project is student-driven with a professor team advisor for technical and management support. The project work includes documentation deliverables as well as a completed prototype. Juniors will stay on the project for a semester while seniors stay on the project for the whole year. 

As a junior, I took clinic in the fall semester when the teams focus on defining the project, initial research and ideation, and rapid prototyping. I worked with the company Trilobio whose mission is to automate manual biology lab processes (e.g. pipetting) in order to increase biologists' bandwidth for designing, executing, and managing research. The problem Trilobio was facing was calibrating and verifying the pipette system especially with fluids of different viscosities. Thus, my clinic team was asked to design an analytical balance that could provide a high resolution measurement of the pipetted mass for an 8-Channel pipette system. 

## Patent Information
The company is currently filing for a patent surrounding the work we provided. AS such, information on the project work is limited. 

## Project Work
While on the Trilobio project, I worked mainly on designing the electrical system for a strain gauge balance prototype. I designed an initial breadboarded circuit to read the strain as a voltage that was then moved to a soldered protoboard for more stability and durability as well as for easier transportation. The electrical design also included interfacing the circuit with an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) to read and process the voltages and convert the voltage back to strain. 

The project opened many avenues of learning from big technical skills like communicating to a microcontroller and analyzing noise sources to small skills like how to familiarize myself with an instrument's datasheet. This project was also the first time I was encountaring hexadecimal instead of binary. The learning curve in this project was extremely large with much of the project training skills of finding information and answers with little professional guidance.  

## Documentation
As clinic is stil a Harvey Mudd class, there were required assignments for documentation and deliverables. During the project, my team and I developed a team charter to outline the project and expectations of team dynamics, a work plan to strategize how to approach the project, and a midyear report to communicate our results for the semester and justifications for design choices. On top of internal documentation deliverables, I kept a notebook for daily progress and work on my assigned design alternative. The notebook came in handy when having to delineate the advantages and pitfalls of the strain gauge prototype and ultimately why the prototype could not meet sensitivity requirements. 

## Acknowledgements
I want to acknowledge my team advisor Professor Mendelson for her advising of the Clinic project. I was taking her Continuum Mechanics class at the same time as the clinic project which aligned well in the teachings and discussions of strain gauges and their behavior under an applied load. I also want to thank my incredible clinic team and clinic team lead for fostering a safe and curious learning environment as well as to the clinic liaisons at Trilobio for being an eager and knowledgable source of feedback. And a special thanks to the coordinators of the clinic class for giving us as undergraduate students the rare opportunity to work on a project provided an overseen by an industry company.
