## Motivation
The Physics of Soft Matter (PoSM) Lab focuses on the research of soft elastic solids to understand biological movement and its applications in robotics. The Slingshot Spider project revolved around researching latch-mediated spring actuation through reproducing the slingshot spider's elastic web in a bioinspired robotic mechanism.

## Research Work
Although I only got to work on this project briefly, I really enjoyed the quick prototyping and experimenting with different web designs and materials. Throughout the semester, I worked on building and testing low resolution prototypes using embroidery hoops, string, tape, and sticky toys as projectiles. 

(insert a picture of the web prototype)

One notable prototype launched a sticky projectile onto the ceiling where it stayed for the rest of the semester. I explored different web designs to investigate the ways in which web geometry and materials and projectile material impacts performance and energy efficiency when launching.

## Acknowledgements
I want to acknowledge my advisor for this research project, Professor Ilton, for the opportunity to work in the PoSM lab. Unfortunately, the research project did not have enough funding to continue after the semester into the summer, but I am so grateful to the guidance of Professor Ilton on my first research project in undergrad.
